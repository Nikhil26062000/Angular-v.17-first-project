# lecture 1 to 6
Creating Components: Use the Angular CLI command ng generate component componentName or its shorthand ng g c componentName to create new components.

Using Components Inside Another: Components can be used inside other components in several ways:

As an element: Use the component's selector as a custom HTML element (the default way).
As an attribute: Apply the component's selector as an attribute on an HTML element.
As a class: Use the component's selector as a class on an HTML element.
Templates and Styles:

Templates: Define the component's HTML using templateUrl for external HTML files or template for inline HTML.
Styles: Define the component's CSS using styleUrls for external CSS files or styles for inline CSS.

# FirstProject

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.1.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
