<div app-employees></div>

<!--
     we can also use 'app-employees' as class . we just have to do some slight changes.
     CHANGES ARE :
        we have to add class keyword in div here . eg : <div class="app-employees"></div>

        we have to do changes in employess.components.ts file also
        changes are:
        
        @Component({
        selector: '.app-employees',
        standalone: true,
        imports: [],
        templateUrl: './employees.component.html',
        styleUrl: './employees.component.scss'
        })
